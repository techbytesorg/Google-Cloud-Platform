# Module 5 – Vertex AI Foundations & Model Garden

This module introduces the **core components of Vertex AI** and shows how to use Google Cloud’s **Model Garden** to access and deploy foundation models like **Gemma**, **Codey**, and **PaLM 2**. You’ll also explore how **embeddings** enable semantic understanding for applications like intelligent search and retrieval.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand **Vertex AI’s key components**: Datasets, Experiments, Endpoints, and Model Registry  
- Learn how to **call hosted foundation models** (PaLM 2, Codey, Gemma)  
- Explore **embeddings** and build **semantic retrieval** systems with Matching Engine  
- Learn how to **deploy a custom model container** to a Vertex AI endpoint  

---

## ❓ Key Questions

- What is the **Model Garden**, and how do you select the right foundation model?  
- How do **embeddings** power semantic search and retrieval?  
- How do you **deploy a custom container model** to Vertex AI?

---

## 💡 Takeaway

Vertex AI provides a unified platform for both **foundation models and custom ML workflows** — from data to deployment.  
With Model Garden and Matching Engine, you can quickly prototype intelligent, search-powered AI systems without leaving Google Cloud.

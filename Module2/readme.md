# Module 2 – Data Engineering for AI

This module explores how data flows through an AI system — from raw collection to feature storage and serving. You’ll learn how Google Cloud’s data engineering components work together to build scalable, reproducible, and cost-efficient data pipelines. Through **Cloud Storage**, **BigQuery**, **Dataflow**, **Pub/Sub**, and **Vertex Feature Store**, you’ll see how data becomes trustworthy, structured, and ready for both training and real-time inference. There will be a basic hands-on component of adding files to Google Cloud Storage and data wrangling through BigQuery.

## ❓ Key Questions

- How do Cloud Storage and BigQuery support reproducible and cost-optimized data management?  
- When should you choose **batch** ingestion versus **streaming** ingestion?  
- How does **Dataflow** (with **Apache Beam**) transform raw data into features?  
- What problems does **Vertex Feature Store** solve in ensuring training-serving consistency?  
- How do these components work together to create a unified, reliable data pipeline for AI?

# Module 3 – EDA and Visualization

This module focuses on how to explore, clean, and visualize data using **BigQuery**, **SQL**, and **Vertex AI Workbench**. You’ll learn how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand your dataset, detect issues, and uncover trends before modeling. The module also covers visual storytelling through **Looker Studio** dashboards and Python-based analysis.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand the EDA process and how to explore datasets safely in BigQuery  
- Use SQL to summarize data, detect missingness, and calculate key metrics  
- Apply **window functions** for ranking, trends, and cumulative insights  
- Create and reuse **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)** for data cleaning and transformations  
- Build simple KPI dashboards in **Looker Studio**  
- Use **Vertex AI Workbench** to query BigQuery in Python, visualize data, and build reproducible analysis workflows

## ❓ Key Questions

- How can you explore and validate your data efficiently in BigQuery?  
- What SQL patterns reveal the “vital signs” of a dataset?  
- When should you use window functions instead of GROUP BY?  
- How can UDFs simplify repetitive data-cleaning logic?  
- What is the best way to connect BigQuery to Looker Studio for visualization?  
- How can you combine SQL and Python in Vertex AI Workbench for deeper analysis?
